## Introduction

We're [WeDAA](https://www.wedaa.tech/), a platform built to help developers design, deploy, and scale microservice architectures. Everything was smooth‚Ä¶ until it wasn‚Äôt. Our cloud provider of choice, Hetzner, gave us an unexpected headache: their load balancers only support five service mappings (yes, just five).

**Spoiler alert**: Kong API Gateway came to our rescue. Here's the story of how we turned a frustrating infrastructure limit into a smooth, scalable setup.

## The Backstory: What‚Äôs WeDAA Anyway?

#### A Platform for Microservice Architecture
[WeDAA](https://www.wedaa.tech/) isn‚Äôt your typical backend-as-a-service. Think of it as the LEGO set for building microservices. Developers piece together services, APIs, and integrations without worrying about the messy backend orchestration.

#### Our Cloud of Choice: Hetzner

![Hetzner](/img/blog/kong-apigateway/hetzner.png)

When we launched, we chose [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) for hosting. It‚Äôs fast, reliable, and super budget-friendly‚Äîwhich is a big deal when you're bootstrapping or scaling quickly.

#### Why Hetzner? Cost vs Features
For the price, Hetzner rocks. But not everything that glitters is gold. While compute and storage were amazing, their load balancer offering had‚Ä¶ well, ‚Äúquirks.‚Äù

## Enter the Challenge: Microservices Meet Their Limit

#### WeDAA‚Äôs Need for Scalability
As a microservices platform, WeDAA doesn‚Äôt run one or two services‚Äîwe run dozens, sometimes more. Each service typically needs to be exposed externally or internally in a managed way.

#### Load Balancers and Path-Based Routing: What‚Äôs the Deal?

Normally, you‚Äôd use a path-based routing strategy. 

![Path-based routing strategy](/img/blog/kong-apigateway/path-based-routing.png)

Like this:

- `/auth` ‚Üí Authentication Service

- `/billing` ‚Üí Billing Service

- `/notifications` ‚Üí Notification Service

Simple, clean, and only one public-facing endpoint required.

#### Hetzner‚Äôs Load Balancer Limitation
But here‚Äôs where it broke down: Hetzner‚Äôs load balancers don‚Äôt support path-based routing. Oof.

Only 5 Port Mappings? Seriously?
Instead, you have to map services by port. So if your LB is lb11, you can only do stuff like:

- Port 8080 ‚Üí Auth

- Port 8081 ‚Üí Billing

- Port 8082 ‚Üí Notifications

...and so on‚Äîbut only 5 of these mappings allowed.

## Load Balancer Bottleneck: Our Initial Struggle

#### Trying to Squeeze Multiple Services Behind One LB
You can see where this is going. We had way more than 5 services.

#### Options We Considered

We brainstormed all possible hacks:

- Buy a bigger load balancer (was an option‚Äîbut the cost jumped fast)

- Spin up more LBs (costly and messy)

- Use a reverse proxy manually (yikes‚Äîcomplex maintenance)

#### All Roads Led to Cost & Complexity

Every workaround added either cost, technical debt, or overhead. We needed something smarter‚Äîa gateway between our load balancer and services.

## Discovering a Smarter Way: Say Hello to Kong API Gateway

#### What is Kong API Gateway, Anyway?

[Kong Gateway](https://docs.konghq.com/gateway/3.10.x/get-started/) is a lightweight, fast, and flexible cloud-native API gateway. Kong Gateway sits in front of your service applications, dynamically controlling, analyzing, and routing requests and responses. Kong Gateway implements your API traffic policies by using a flexible, low-code, plugin-based approach.

It's like a digital traffic cop that decides where to send API requests based on path, headers, method‚Äîyou name it.

#### How Kong Helped Us Bypass LB Limitations
With Kong sitting behind the load balancer, we only needed to expose one service‚ÄîKong itself. Then Kong handled internal routing to all our microservices based on the URL path.

#### One Service, Multiple Paths
Boom. Now instead of mapping 5 different ports on the LB, we had:

- lb11:443 ‚Üí Kong

    - `/auth`          ‚Üí Auth Service
    - `/billing`       ‚Üí Billing Service
    - `/notifications` ‚Üí Notification Service
    - `/anything`      ‚Üí Any Service We Wanted

#### Internal Routing Made Simple
All services were registered with Kong. We configured routing rules, and it took care of the rest. No extra LBs. No extra cost.


## A Real-World Architecture Shift
#### Before Kong: Chaos
Dozens of services, all needing public access, but limited to 5. It was like trying to stuff an elephant into a mini-fridge.

#### After Kong: Clarity

Now it‚Äôs:

Hetzner LB ‚Üí Kong ‚Üí All internal microservices

```
[Internet] ‚Üí [Hetzner LB] ‚Üí [Kong API Gateway] ‚Üí [Service A, B, C...Z]
```

Clean, scalable, and way easier to manage.

## Would We Do It Again? 100% Yes

#### Scalability Without Extra Costs
We‚Äôre saving $$$ by not buying extra load balancers.

#### Future-Proofing the Platform
Need to add 10 more services? 50? No problem‚ÄîKong‚Äôs got it.

#### Faster Deployments
New service? Register with Kong, deploy, and done. No port juggling.

## Wrapping Up: Kong API Gateway ‚Äì Game-Changer in Our Stack

If you're running multiple services and your cloud provider‚Äôs load balancer has limitations, Kong can help. It did the job for us‚Äîquickly and without adding complexity.

What started as a problem with too many services turned into a simple solution. Now, Kong is a key part of our setup‚Äîand we‚Äôre not looking back.
