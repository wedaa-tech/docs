This blog post takes you on a journey to enhance the security of your React app by seamlessly integrating it with [**Keycloak**](https://www.keycloak.org/documentation), a robust authentication and authorization server. To simplify this process, we\'ll leverage the npm package [**react-oidc-context**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-oidc-context), bridging React and Keycloak while implementing OpenID Connect (OIDC). Whether you\'re a seasoned developer or just stepping into React and authentication, this post provides practical insights to bolster the security posture of your web application. Let\'s dive into the world of React, Keycloak, and react-oidc-context for a more secure development experience.\\n\\n### \ud83d\ude80 Quickstart:\\n\\n1. Visit [**app.wedaa.tech**](https://app.wedaa.tech/)\\n\\n2. Click on the \\"Static Web page\\" component\\n\\n   ![Choose Framework](https://i.imgur.com/aCPQE39.png)\\n\\n3.

Review your prototype configuration, then click Next\\n\\n   ![Prototype Configuration](https://i.imgur.com/NYlY6pF.png)\\n\\n8. Finally, click \\"Generate Code\\" to download the secured React application\\n\\n   ![Generate Code](https://i.imgur.com/kJiRTHB.png)\\n\\n\\n\\nWeDAA offers a pre-configured React application secured by Keycloak. Simply extract our application, follow the instructions in the README, and initiate your application to seamlessly experience it first-hand.\\n\\n### \ud83e\udde0 Understanding the Generated Code \\n\\n1. src/index.js\\n\\n```jsx\\n// Code for initializing React application with authentication and authorization capabilities.\\nimport React from \'react\';\\nimport ReactDOM from \'react-dom/client\';\\nimport \'./index.css\';\\nimport App from \'./App\';\\nimport reportWebVitals from \'./reportWebVitals\';\\nimport { AuthProvider } from \'react-oidc-context\';\\n\\nconst oidcConfig = {\\n  authority: process.env.REACT_APP_OIDC_AUTHORITY,\\n  client_id: process.env.REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID,\\n  redirect_uri: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_URL,\\n  // ...\\n};\\n\\nconst root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById(\'root\'));\\nroot.render(\\n  <AuthProvider {...oidcConfig}>\\n    <App />\\n  </AuthProvider>\\n);\\n\\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\\n// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals\\nreportWebVitals();\\n\\n```\\n\\n- This code initializes a React application with authentication and authorization capabilities using the [**react-oidc-context**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-oidc-context) library.\\n\\n- The main application (App) is wrapped in an AuthProvider with configurations derived from the OIDC parameters specified in the oidcConfig object.\\n\\n- The oidcConfig object contains configuration parameters required for OpenID Connect authentication.\\n\\n- Environment variables (```REACT_APP_OIDC_AUTHORITY, REACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID, and REACT_APP_PROJECT_URL```) are used to dynamically set these values.\\n\\n2. dotenv (.env file)\\n\\n```jsx\\n// Environment variables for configuring the React application.\\nPORT=4200\\nGENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false\\n\\nREACT_APP_PROJECT_NAME=webapp\\nREACT_APP_PROJECT_URL=http://localhost:4200\\n\\n\\n# WEDAA \\nREACT_APP_WEDAA_DOCS=https://wedaa-tech.github.io\\nREACT_APP_WEDAA_GITHUB=https://github.com/wedaa-tech\\n\\n# OIDC Configuration\\nREACT_APP_OIDC_AUTHORITY=http://localhost:9080/realms/jhipster\\nREACT_APP_OIDC_CLIENT_ID=web_app\\n\\n```\\n\\n3. src/config/auth/privateRoute.js\\n\\n```jsx\\n// Code for defining a PrivateRoute component for protecting routes based on authentication status.\\nimport React from \'react\';\\nimport { useAuth } from \'react-oidc-context\';\\n\\nconst PrivateRoute = ({ children }) => {\\n  const auth = useAuth();\\n\\n  switch (auth.activeNavigator) {\\n    case \'signinSilent\':\\n      return <div>Signing you in...</div>;\\n    case \'signoutRedirect\':\\n      return <div>Signing you out...</div>;\\n  }\\n\\n  if (auth.isLoading) {\\n    // <div>Loading...</div>;\\n    return <div></div>;\\n  }\\n\\n  if (auth.error) {\\n    return <div>Oops... {auth.error.message}</div>;\\n  }\\n  if (!auth.isAuthenticated) {\\n    let originPath = window.location.pathname;\\n    auth.signinRedirect({\\n      redirect_uri: process.env.REACT_APP_PROJECT_URL.concat(originPath),\\n    });\\n  }\\n\\n  if (auth.isAuthenticated) {\\n    window.history.replaceState({}, document.title, window.location.pathname);\\n    return <>{children}</>;\\n  }\\n};\\n\\nexport default PrivateRoute;\\n\\n```\\n\\n- This code defines a React component called PrivateRoute that serves as a wrapper for protecting certain routes in your application based on authentication status. \\n\\n- The PrivateRoute component takes a children prop, which represents the content that should be rendered if the user is authenticated.\\n\\n- Switch statement checks the activeNavigator property in the authentication context. If the user is in the process of a silent sign-in or sign-out redirect, it displays a corresponding message.\\n\\n- If the authentication context is still loading, the component returns an empty div (essentially doing nothing until authentication data is available).\\n\\n- If the user is not authenticated, it initiates a redirection to the authentication server using the signinRedirect method. It also captures the current path to redirect the user back to the intended page after authentication.\\n\\n- If the user is authenticated, it updates the browser history to remove sensitive information and renders the original children content.\\n\\n4. docker/\\n\\n```\\n|_docker\\n    |_realm-config\\n            |_jhipster-realm.json\\n    |_keycloak.yml\\n```\\n\\n- The Docker directory houses a Docker Compose configuration for Keycloak. This configuration initiates a Keycloak container that serves as the authentication server for our React application.\\n\\n- Within the docker/realm-config directory, there is a JSON-formatted realm configuration. This information, presented in JSON format, is essential for our React application as it serves as the OIDC (OpenID Connect) configuration.\\n\\n\\n### \ud83d\udea6 Getting Started\\n\\n1.

With technology\'s daily progress, we witness fresh parameters and approaches applied to our existing setups.\\n \\nTo draw a parallel, consider the preparation of a delectable Biryani. The first step is to gather the right ingredients before diving into cooking. Spices, curd, salt, rice, and, of course, gasoline are essential. Most of these ingredients remain constant for everyone, while the art of cooking is what distinguishes one chef from another. Given that the ingredients remain the same, isn\'t it impractical to painstakingly prepare them from scratch each time we crave Biryani? It certainly is.\\n \\nIn contrast to the culinary world, in software engineering, we often find ourselves writing and configuring all components from scratch each time we embark on building a software solution.\\n \\nLet\'s consider a hypothetical scenario in software engineering: creating a full-stack application. It entails the development of numerous microservices, handling discovery, gateway, and inter-service communication. Additionally, we must set up logging, observability, security, and privacy mechanisms. Now, ponder this: countless others have undertaken these exact same tasks tens of thousands of times. Isn\'t it time to rethink our approach and prepare and assemble common technical components in advance, much like having essential spices ready when cooking Biryani.\\n \\nStarting from scratch each time leads to complications, extended development timelines, and monotony. As a software project expands and requires more boilerplate code, a developer\'s workload becomes increasingly burdensome. We must simultaneously ensure a solid foundation for our application\'s architecture. So, the question arises: where do we seek a solution? The answer lies in a scaffolding platform, where we build common components once and assemble them as needed.\\n \\nScaffolding represents a modern approach to generating the common building blocks of an application and configuring them to meet the software requirements. An effective scaffold might encompass features such as login and registration pages, service and server connections, routing, discovery, model templates, controllers, security, privacy, and observability mechanisms.\\n \\nThe next time you embark on application development, consider WeDAA, a platform designed for rapid prototyping and scaffolding of technologies and applications.\\n \\nWhat You\'ll Achieve:\\n \\nExpedited proposal development.\\nUnified systems for design, configurations, and asset control.\\nEnhanced security and privacy standards right from the start.\\nMore time to focus on your unique business case rather than common tasks.\\""}]}')}}]);
